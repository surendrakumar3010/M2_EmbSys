## WATER LEVEL INDICATOR USING AURDINO AND ULTRA SONIC SENSOR

# Abstract: 
water tank overflow is a common problem which leads to the wastage of water. though there are 
many solutions to it like ball valves which automatically stop the water flow once the tank gets full. 
but being electronics enthusiastic wouldn't you like an electronic solution for it? so here is a simple 
and handy that will guide you to make a circuit which will detect the water level and will raise an alarm 
upon getting the water tank full or a pre-set level. water level indicator is a modern way of measuring 
the water level using latest technologies like sensors, Arduino. the main aim of the project is to 
calculate the water level at any instant of time and to buzz the buzzer if the tank is filled completely. I 
would like to use Arduino and ultrasonic sensor to make it possible. this may be useful to conserve 
water and helps us not to waste water. 

# INTRODUCTION: 
 The facility requirements in many industries, farms, hostels, hotels, offices include an overhead tank 
for water, which is usually fed through an electric pump that is switched off when the tank is filled up 
and switched on when it is empty. so, the most common way of knowing when the tank is filled is by 
observing when it overflows the brim. depending on the type of liquid being handled, overfilling of 
such a tank could lead to a great liquid material loss ranging in the order of thousands of naira per 
week depending on the extent of such application. these losses can be prevented if the tank is 
monitored automatically by incorporating feedback. water level indicator using ultrasonic sensor 
&Arduino is an amazing and very useful project. the objective of this project is to notify the user the 
amount of water that is present in the overhead water tank. this project can be further enhanced to 
control the water level in the tank by turning it on, when the water level is low, and turning it off when 
the water level is high. thus, the Arduino water level indicator helps in preventing wastage of water in 
overhead tank. a transmitter circuit and a receiver circuit. the transmitter circuit makes use of an 
ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in terms of distance. this data is sent to the receiver 
circuit using rf communication. 

# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to notify the user the amount of water that is present in the overhead 
water tank and donâ€™t waste water.
