# Water Level Indicator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Introduction:

In relation with the current framework with so much work and too less time to spare, it is very difficult to keep in
touch with the water level in the tanks. Water is essential in every hour of our lives. Hardly anyone keeps in track of
the level of water in the overhead tanks. The objective of the project is to measure the level of water in the tank and
notify the user about the water level . This not only helps to keep the tank full but also making
it more convenient for our day-to-day chores and also avoiding water wastage. In this project, the water is being
measured by using ultrasonic sensors. Initially, the tank is considered to be empty. When the sound waves are
transmitted in the environment, they are reflected back as ECHO. This same concept is applied this project. Waves
generated by the ultrasonic sensors is sent to the water tank and their time of travelling and coming back is noted
and after few calculations we can estimate the level of water in the tank.

# Objectives:

The objective of this project is to notify the user the amount of water that is present in the overhead water tank.



# Benifits:

i)Easy installation.

ii)Minimal maintenance.

iii)Sends an alert to let you know water is too high or too low.

iv)Low & High alarms.

v)Compact design.

vi)Automatically adjusts water levels.

vii)Save money by using less electricity and water.

# 4W's And 1H
# Who
In our day to day activities, it is common to all to have shortage of water or overflow of water in our storage tanks. 
# What
“The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.” 
# When
A water level indicator is a system that relays information back to a control panel to indicate whether a body of water has a high or low water level. Some water level indicators use a combination of probe sensors or float switches to sense water levels.
# Where
The purpose of a water level indicator is to gauge and manage water levels in a water tank. The control panel can also be programmed to automatically turn on a water pump once levels get too low and refill the water back to the adequate level.
# How
The working principle of a water level indicator is actually quite simple. Water level indicators work by using sensor probes to indicate water levels in a storage tank. These probes send information back to the control panel to trigger an alarm or indicator. As mentioned above, the control panel can be programmed to automatically turn on your pump to refill the water again.

# Applications:
i)It can be used in large scale to control the water level in dams to prevent flood and other such problems.

ii) It can be used to control water wastage in the municipality corporation tanks which supply water in a particular
area.

iii) It can widely be used in industrial purposes as well.
