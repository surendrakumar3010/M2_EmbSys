# Water Level Indicator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Abstract:
water tank overflow is a common problem which leads to the wastageof water. though there are many solutions to it like ball valves which automatically stopthe water flow once the tank gets full. but being electronics enthusiastic wouldn't you likean electronic solution for it? so here is a simple and handy diy that will guide you to makea circuit which will detect the water level and will raise an alarm upon getting the watertank full or a preset level.water level indicator is a modern way of measuring the water level using latesttechnologies like sensors ,arduino. the main aim of the project is to calculate the water levelat any instant of time and to buzz the buzzer if the tank is filled completely.i would like to usearduino and ultrasonic sensor to make it possible. this may be useful to conserve water andhelps us not to waste water.

# Introduction:

In relation with the current framework with so much work and too less time to spare, it is very difficult to keep in
touch with the water level in the tanks. Water is essential in every hour of our lives. Hardly anyone keeps in track of
the level of water in the overhead tanks. The objective of the project is to measure the level of water in the tank and
notify the user about the water level . This not only helps to keep the tank full but also making
it more convenient for our day-to-day chores and also avoiding water wastage. In this project, the water is being
measured by using ultrasonic sensors. Initially, the tank is considered to be empty. When the sound waves are
transmitted in the environment, they are reflected back as ECHO. This same concept is applied this project. Waves
generated by the ultrasonic sensors is sent to the water tank and their time of travelling and coming back is noted
and after few calculations we can estimate the level of water in the tank.

# Objectives:

The objective of this project is to notify the user the amount of water that is present in the overhead water tank.



# Benifits:

i)Easy installation.

ii)Minimal maintenance.

iii)Sends an alert to let you know water is too high or too low.

iv)Low & High alarms.

v)Compact design.

vi)Automatically adjusts water levels.

vii)Save money by using less electricity and water.

# Description:

# Arduino board UNO:
Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.

Arduino UNO features AVR microcontroller Atmega328, 6 analogue input pins, and 14 digital I/O pins out of which 6 are used as PWM output.

# Ultra Sonic sensor:
An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter (which emits the sound using piezoelectric crystals) and the receiver (which encounters the sound after it has travelled to and from the target).

# Resistor:
A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.

# LED:
Light-emitting diode (LED) is a widely used standard source of light in electrical equipment. It has a wide range of applications ranging from your mobile phone to large advertising billboards. They mostly find applications in devices that show the time and display different types of data.

# Bread board:
A breadboard, or protoboard, is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used when slicing bread.In the 1970s the solderless breadboard ( plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to these.


# 4W's And 1H
# Who
In our day to day activities, it is common to all to have shortage of water or overflow of water in our storage tanks. 
# What
“The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.” 
# When
A water level indicator is a system that relays information back to a control panel to indicate whether a body of water has a high or low water level. Some water level indicators use a combination of probe sensors or float switches to sense water levels.
# Where
The purpose of a water level indicator is to gauge and manage water levels in a water tank. The control panel can also be programmed to automatically turn on a water pump once levels get too low and refill the water back to the adequate level.
# How
The working principle of a water level indicator is actually quite simple. Water level indicators work by using sensor probes to indicate water levels in a storage tank. These probes send information back to the control panel to trigger an alarm or indicator. As mentioned above, the control panel can be programmed to automatically turn on your pump to refill the water again.
